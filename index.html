              <h2>Author Bio</h2>
              <p>
                Howard Phillips Lovecraft was an American writer of weird, science,
                fantasy, and horror fiction. He is best known for his creation of
                the Cthulhu Mythos.
              </p>
              <p>
                Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Lovecraft spent most of his life
                in New England. After his father's institutionalization in 1893, he
                lived affluently until his family's wealth dissipated after the
                death of his grandfather. Lovecraft then lived with his mother, in
                reduced financial security, until her institutionalization in 1919.
                He began to write essays for the United Amateur Press Association,
                and in 1913 wrote a critical letter to a pulp magazine that
                ultimately led to his involvement in pulp fiction. He became active
                in the speculative fiction community and was published in several
                pulp magazines. Lovecraft moved to New York City, marrying Sonia
                Greene in 1924, and later became the center of a wider group of
                authors known as the "Lovecraft Circle". They introduced him to
                Weird Tales, which became his most prominent publisher. Lovecraft's
                time in New York took a toll on his mental state and financial
                conditions. He returned to Providence in 1926 and produced some of
                his most popular works, including "The Call of Cthulhu", At the
                Mountains of Madness, The Shadow over Innsmouth, and The Shadow Out
                of Time. He remained active as a writer for 11 years until his death
                from intestinal cancer at the age of 46.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lovecraft's literary corpus is rooted in cosmicism, which was
                simultaneously his personal philosophy and the main theme of his
                fiction. Cosmicism posits that humanity is an insignificant part of
                the cosmos and could be swept away at any moment. He incorporated
                fantasy and science fiction elements into his stories, representing
                the perceived fragility of anthropocentrism. This was tied to his
                ambivalent views on knowledge. His works were largely set in a
                fictionalized version of New England. Civilizational decline also
                plays a major role in his works, as he believed that the West was in
                decline during his lifetime. Lovecraft's early political views were
                conservative and traditionalist; additionally, he held a number of
                racist views for much of his adult life. Following the Great
                Depression, Lovecraft's political views became more socialist while
                still remaining elitist and aristocratic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout his adult life, Lovecraft was never able to support
                himself from his earnings as an author and editor. He was virtually
                unknown during his lifetime and was almost exclusively published in
                pulp magazines before his death. A scholarly revival of Lovecraft's
                work began in the 1970s, and he is now regarded as one of the most
                significant 20th-century authors of supernatural horror fiction.
                Many direct adaptations and spiritual successors followed. Works
                inspired by Lovecraft, adaptations or original works, began to form
                the basis of the Cthulhu Mythos, which utilizes Lovecraft's
                characters, setting, and themes.

                  <h3>The Quintessential Lovecraft</h3>
                  <p>
                    Story Every reader of Lovecraft pays tribute to this story,
                    and therefore, it is number one. It has an instrumental by
                    Metallica, numerous cartoons, comics, T-shirts, crossword
                    puzzles, and many other things that all pay homage to this
                    epic. Even the roleplaying game, Dungeons & Dragons has a race
                    (Illithids) based on the octopoid, human-like appearance of
                    the dead god. The main objects of the story are a series of
                    manuscripts: a bas-relief depicting the creature created from
                    the dreams of a student artist and the ancient, esoteric being
                    who came to earth millions of years ago. In setting, it moves
                    from Rhode Island to St. Louis, finally resting in an
                    uncharted ocean area in the Pacific near 47°9′S 126°43′W.
                    (Perhaps you will note the similarities between the ending of
                    this story and the story "Dagon.") Ironically, Lovecraft
                    thought this writing was only fair among his efforts; it was
                    rejected originally by Weird Tales but later published by
                    Robert E. Howard (author of the Conan stories) who praised it.
                    And ultimately, while the debate will continue among his fans,
                    "The Call of Cthulhu" will forever be the single piece of
                    literature that defines H.P. Lovecraft.
                   <p class="quote">
                      That is not dead which can eternal lie, <br>
                      And with strange aeons even death may die <br>
                      — "The Call of Cthulhu"

                  <p>
                    Picking "The Whisperer in Darkness" as number two was a really
                    hard sell. First of all, there are numerous other stories with
                    greater mention and accolades when referring to the author.
                    Furthermore, this was a transition period for Lovecraft
                    (published in 1931), moving more toward science fiction and
                    less towards horror. But this story has it all. The reader is
                    introduced to the Mi-go, an alien race of "large, pinkish,
                    fungoid, crustacean-like entities the size of a man," gory
                    embellishments, and yes, a near-complete compendium of Cthulhu
                    Mythos references. In one sentence, the attributions are
                    numerous: "I found myself faced by names and terms that I had
                    heard elsewhere in the most hideous of connections—Yuggoth,
                    Great Cthulhu, Tsathoggua, Yog-Sothoth, R'lyeh, Nyarlathotep,
                    Azathoth, Hastur, Yian, Leng, the Lake of Hali, Bethmoora, the
                    Yellow Sign, L'mur-Kathulos, Bran, and the Magnum
                    Innominandum..." Aside from its contents, the plot is
                    exhilarating. Albert N. Wilmarth, an instructor at Miskatonic
                    University, investigates a disturbing letter only to learn the
                    truth about an alien race with malevolent morals and
                    intentions toward humankind. It's number two on this list
                    because the story inspires great thought and imagination.

                  <h3>Enter the Deep Ones</h3>
                  <p>
                    Set in the village of Innsmouth, Massachusetts, Robert
                    Olmstead was only revealed later to be the narrator and main
                    character of the story through notes presented by the
                    authorized Lovecraft publisher Arkham House. Through his
                    travels as a scholar of genealogy, he encounters the city and
                    its abnormal resident, with traits that cause him concern.
                    Later, he learns many nefarious rumors and gains insight from,
                    perhaps, the only human inhabitant, a town drunk named Zadok
                    Allen. This is an excellent primer to the deity Cthulhu and a
                    masterpiece recognized by the Lovecraft community. The
                    architectural descriptions are a fascinating assemblage of
                    images as well as the concept of an amphibious race corrupting
                    the human stock.

                  <p>This story fully embeds us in the Cthulhu Mythos, centering on the Professor of Geology at Miskatonic University, William Dyer, who has returned from a horrifying expedition to the Antarctic. His only goal now is to prevent others from returning to that deadly place.

                    "At the Mountains of Madness" is vividly descriptive of the icy wastes, dark artifacts, and fear-inspiring remnants of a lost civilization that rose before the coming of man. It also introduces the Shoggoth, a creature of some infamy to Lovecraftian. Throughout, though, there is something unspoken on the Professor's mind, something he cannot put into words, which lies beyond the ruins.
                    
                    After the first paragraph, this story puts an Indiana Jones meets Hellboy twist on the reader, making it worthy of number five for Lovecraft.</p>

  <h2>August William Derleth</h2>
  <h3>February 24, 1909 - July 4, 1971</h3>
  <p>We will start things off with the most famous (or perhaps most infamous) of the Lovecraft Circle. August Derleth. Derleth, was one of the young correspondents and friends of H.P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft even paid homage to Derleth when he wrote of “le Comte d’Erlette” who was the French aristocrat and fictional author of Cultes des Goules, the name was inspired by the ancestral form of August Derleth’s family name.</p>
  <p>When Lovecraft died in 1937, Derleth along with Donald Wandrei assembled a collection of Lovecraft’s stories and attempted to find a publisher for them. When they were unable to find anyone interested in the work they founded Arkham House publishing in 1939 to print the work themselves. Among many other things Derleth is also responsible for coming up with the term of “Cthulhu Mythos” which is a kind of umbrella term used by many people when talking about the different “Lovecraftian” monsters. Thus it should go without saying that Lovecraft’s work was saved from literary obscurity in large part to the work of August Derleth and Arkham House.</p>
  <p>So why is it that the man who helped make Lovecraft famous is so unpopular with many Lovecraft fans? There are a number of reasons for this however I think the biggest problem that Lovecraft fans have with August Derleth is the fact that many people feel he used Lovecraft’s name to publish his own work. Following Lovecraft’s death, Derleth wrote a number of stories based on fragments and notes left by Lovecraft. These were published under the byline “H. P. Lovecraft and August Derleth”, with Derleth going so far as calling himself a “posthumous collaborator”. It is also believed that many of these stories were wrote entirely by Derleth and then published using Lovecraft’s name to help with selling his work.</p>
  <p>Another reason is that Derleth’s own writing emphasized the struggle between good and evil, which were more in line with his own Christian views. This was in stark contrast with Lovecraft’s depiction of an amoral universe. Derleth also treated Lovecraft’s Old Ones as representatives of elemental forces, creating new entities to flesh out these ideas. Many of Derleth’s in the “Cthulhu Mythos” were very different from what Lovecraft himself would have approved of.</p>
  <p>But what about Lovecraft encouraging other writers to take his ideas and run with them? Would Lovecraft have approved of Derleth’s ideas? We will never know what the man himself would have thought of his creations being used as examples of good and evil or primal forces. I personally think he would have supported the idea but disliked the writing. As for being “posthumous collaborator” I don’t think Lovecraft would have been very happy with this comment. Lovecraft was very particular about what he wrote and what he liked. I don’t think he would have appreciated having his name associated with writing that was not up to his standards. But that’s just my opinion…</p>
  <p>Regardless of what you or I personally feel about August Derleth no one can deny that with him the world may never have been given the chance to enjoy the works of H.P. Lovecraft. If that means he gets to put his name next to Lovecraft’s on a book cover then perhaps that’s a small price to pay.</p>

  <img id="lovecraftHead" src="./clark_ashton_smith.webp" alt="Picture of Smith">
  <h2>Clark Ashton Smith</h2>
  <h3>January 13, 1893 – August 14, 1961</h3>
  <p>Smith was a poet, artist and writer who is best known for his contributions to Wierd Tales magazine around the same time that Lovecraft was writing and contributing as well. The publication of Ebony and Crystal in 1922 was followed by a fan letter from H. P. Lovecraft, which was the beginning of fifteen years of friendship and correspondence.</p>
  <p>Like Lovecraft Smith was not very well off during his life. Unlike Lovecraft however Smith did find work doing other things such as picking fruit and wood cutting.</p>
  <p>Smith wrote most of his weird fiction and Cthulhu Mythos stories, partially inspired by H. P. Lovecraft. Creatures of his invention include Aforgomon, Rlim-Shaikorth, Mordiggian, Tsathoggua, the wizard Eibon, and various others. In an homage to his friend, Lovecraft referred in some of his stories to a great dark wizard, “Klarkash-Ton.”</p>
  <p>Smith’s stories form several cycles, called after the lands in which they are set: Averoigne, Hyperborea, Mars, Poseidonis, Xiccarph, Zothique. Stories set in Zothique belong to the Dying Earth subgenre.
  </p>
  <p>Many of Smith’s stories were published in six hardcover volumes by August Derleth under his Arkham House imprint. Some of them were also collected as Lost Worlds Vols 1 and 2.</p>

  <h2>Robert Bloch</h2>
  <h3>April 5, 1917 – September 23, 1994</h3>
  <p class="quote">“Despite my ghoulish reputation, I really have the heart of a small boy. I keep it in a jar on my desk,”</p>
  <p>Best known as the writer of Psycho, Robert Bloch was one of the youngest members of the Lovecraft Circle. As an avid fan of Weird Tales and the works of H.P. Lovecraft, a young Bloch wrote a fan letter to H.P.L. in 1933 and the two soon began to correspond on a regular basis. Not long after Bloch would begin to correspond with other members of the Lovecraft Circle such as Smith and Derleth.</p>
  <p>Bloch’s early stories were very strongly influenced by Lovecraft. A number of his tales were set in the world of Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos. Bloch should also be credited with the invention of several Mythos texts such as De Vermis Mysteriis and Cultes des Goules.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the ultimate honor bestowed upon a young Bloch was to have Lovecraft use a thinly veiled likeness of himself used as the character Robert Blake in the story The Haunter of the Dark. </p>
  <p>After Lovecraft’s death (which effected Bloch deeply) he began to explore different styles of writing. His later works would include, crime dramas, fantasy, science-fiction as well as horror. He would go on to win a Bram Stoker Award a Hugo and a World Fantasy Award. But the roots of his career began by emulating Lovecraft.</p>
